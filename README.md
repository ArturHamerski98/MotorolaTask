why do you code - is it just a professional matter or something more?

It is mainly a professional matter, but I also code because it gives me a lot of joy, especially in my part-time job in which I teach children how to program. Seeing their happiness when they create their first websites, develop their dream games and compile "Hello World" for the first time gives me a sense of fulfillment and makes me feel motivated to develop myself. However, I mainly code because I associate my future with a job as a programmer. Currently, I am on a Dean's leave, before the 4th year of IT studies in AGH and I have decided that most of my free time will be spent on learning and improving my programming skills and the Motorola course is what will definitely help me with this.
